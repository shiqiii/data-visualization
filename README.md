# Data Visualization: Iowa Liquor Sales in 2020

## Introduction
This is a data visualization project of Iowa Liquor Sales in 2020. The data set is provided by the Iowa Department of Commerce, Alcoholic Beverages Division. The Iowa Department of Commerce requires that every store that sells alcohol in bottled form for off-the-premises consumption must hold a class "E" liquor license (an arrangement typical of most of the state alcohol regulatory bodies). All alcoholic sales made by stores registered thusly with the Iowa Department of Commerce are logged in the Commerce department system, which is in turn published as open data by the State of Iowa. The data points in 2020 were chosen to study some interesting questions about Iowa's liquor sales in this year.

## Questions
To explore our dataset, the following five questions are used as the starting points to create the visualizations.
1. How much liquor is sold and consumed in each county? Which county has the most orders for liquor?
2. How many items are in each category? What are the most popular and least popular categories?
3. Which 10 stores have the most liquor sales and how does the monthly sales change?
4. Which order has the most profit? How many bottles were sold on the order? What is the price difference between the Beverage Division and the Store?
5. Is there any relationship between liquor sales and time, such as month and season?

## Main Task
Use interactive data visualization plots to answer the questions.
